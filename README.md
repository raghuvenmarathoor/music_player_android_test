# music_player_android_test

First android app. 


A test to create a music player app which support voice command to search for songs. 

Created using a tutorial based on 
http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-project-setup--mobile-22764

changes from the original code:

1. added a floating action button
2. used voice command properties.
3. used recyclerview instead of listview
4. notifications avoided for playback service (will be back, as services are created without notifications)
5. change in code for recyclerview adapters.
6. design changes ( progress bar is not implemented)
